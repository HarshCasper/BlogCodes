# Dog Cat Binary Classification using Transfer Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

In this Machine Learning Project, we have explored how we can make use of MobileNet Pre-Trained Model to develop a Machine Learning Model that can predict if a picture belongs to a Cat
or a Dog using Transfer Learning. The things that we explore throughout the article are:

- Understanding Transfer Learning
- How Transfer Learning can be used on a new Dataset?
- Pre-Processing the Dataset with Keras
- Data Modelling with Transfer Learning and Pre-Trained Weights
- Visualizing the Results
